## All about Me!: The Website
_Yes I know it's spelled wrong. I'm too lazy to fix and change it._

This is a fun personal project about putting me in website form. My likes, pets, and other projects I've worked on can all be stored here as a sort of catalog. It's also a project for learning HTML, CSS, JS and other web devolopment software.

## The Plan

#put image here!!!

Because this is about me, the plan is to combine my love of the mountains/outdoors and coding/command line stuff. This will be done with 2 'modes'. 
1. As the webcite is first loaded you see the mountian background and otherthings like my cat and stuff hanging around. On the ground or someplace cool will be a bright something that is a button to get to the other mode. 
2. This mode, one activiated, pulls up a slightly transparent terminal, similar to a linux command line terminal. From there it will have intructions and folders containing anything I want to show off. Projects, pictures, work history, whatever. This should be accessiable to users that have never even touched a terminal with intructions for commands, the -help code to find intructions again and some custom commands for ease of use.
